# Setup Mega Account docker!
____
For all email related stuff this container extends https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver which is definitely a bit overkill but why reinvent the wheel...
____
1. Get a domain:
    - I recomend using [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en) mainly because it is _free_ and the only people to see it will be mega.nz.

2. Create .env with domain name
```
DOMAINNAME=example.com
```
